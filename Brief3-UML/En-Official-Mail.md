Sub: DAWA Pharmacy modelisation is complete

Dear Sir/Manager,

I am writing to you because I would like to inform you that the first modelisation of the project DAWA Pharmacy is complete. Thus, I'm requesting a second meeting at a time that's more suitable for you. In the meeting we will discuss the project  further details, take your feedback and hopefully your approval.

For reference, I have attached a Folder containing all resources of the project.

Kind regards,
